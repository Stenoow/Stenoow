# 👋 Hello, I'm Jeremie!

I'm a Full Stack Developer, a part-time coffee enthusiast, and a full-time code wizard! I craft seamless web applications and occasionally cast spells to debug my code. With expertise in both frontend and backend development, I strive to create efficient, user-friendly solutions—because who has time for clunky interfaces?

## 💻 About Me

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects and innovative web applications. Let’s make some magic together!
- 📫 How to reach me: [LinkedIn Profile](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/jeremie-bomont-587268216). I promise I don't bite—unless you bring up Internet Explorer.
