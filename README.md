# 👋 Hello, I'm Jeremie!

I'm a Full Stack Developer, a part-time coffee enthusiast, and a full-time code wizard! I craft seamless web applications and occasionally cast spells to debug my code. With expertise in both frontend and backend development, I strive to create efficient, user-friendly solutions—because who has time for clunky interfaces?

## 💻 About Me

- 🌱 I’m learning about Java/Spring Boot. Because even developers need to evolve (or become a true dev ?)!
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects and innovative web applications. Let’s make some magic together!
- 📫 How to reach me: [LinkedIn Profile](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/jeremie-bomont-587268216). I promise I don't bite—unless you bring up Internet Explorer.
- ⚡ Fun fact: "There’s no place like 127.0.0.1." It's where all the cool kids hang out!

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

### Frontend
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, TypeScript
- Frameworks: React, Angular, Vue.js, ThreeJs, BootStrap

### Backend
- Node.js, Express.js
- Python, PHP, Java
- Frameworks: Laravel, Symfony, Spring Boot
- Database: MongoDB, MySQL, MariaDB

### DevOps
- Docker
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions

### Testing & Automation
- **Playwright**: For when you need your web app tested faster than you can say “end-to-end.”
- **Cucumber.js**: Writing tests in plain English—because even non-techies should understand why things break.

### Tools
- Git, GitHub, GitLab (saving my sanity since 2021)
- Jetbrain tools like PhpStorm or PyCharm, IntelliJ, Visual Studio Code, Postman

## 🌱 Learning Journey

I'm always looking to expand my skill set. Here are some topics I'm currently diving into:

- **Backend:** Java / Spring Boot
